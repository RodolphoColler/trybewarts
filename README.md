# Trybewarts

This project was made with a classmate, the objective was learn
how to use css flex box, practice javascript
DOM and get use to use git, resolve conflicts, merge 
branchs, create pull requests and things like that.

Trybewarts is one of the first pages that i made, so the code is not
the best but i wanted to post it cause its kinda great see my
progresse and think 'fortunately i will never code like this anymore'
